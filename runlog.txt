714 Rerun of 701 using 0.0625 R_E MpGrid with the Hall Effect Turned on

715 Run with 0.0625 R_E MpGrid with anomalous resistivity;
	FAILURE: The Code used Hall Effect on successive restarts.

Changing approach to performing simulations.  The simulation will be
initialized with a 5000 iteration pre-conditioning using the constant
resistivity. A subsequent 1 minute Time Accurate mode will set the
1/16 R_E higher resolution grid, again with constant resistivity of
2.0E9.  All subsequent restarts will restart from this one minute
restart file, where the different reconnection physics parameters will
be turned on from different PARAM files.  The constant resistivity
simulation will serve as our control to compare how the physics and
the magnetosphere changes.

716 - Run of the new simulation initialization conditions with
      constant resistivity.

717 - New initialization with Anomalous Resistivity

718 - New initialization with Hall Effect 1x

719 - New initialization for Hall Effect 2x - COMPLETED

720 - New initialization for Numerical Eta - COMPLETED

721 - New initialization for Constant Eta - COMPLETED

722 - New initialization for Anomalous Eta - COMPLETED
