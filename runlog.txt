709 - Rerun of 701; explicit IE components in Restart file.

710 - Run of 701 with coupled-CIMI

711 - Run of 702 with coupled-CIMI

712 - Run of 703 with coupled-CIMI

713

714 - Rerun of 701 using 0.0625 R_E MpGrid with the Hall Effect Turned on

715 - Run with 0.0625 R_E MpGrid with anomalous resistivity;
	FAILURE: The Code used Hall Effect on successive restarts.

Changing approach to performing simulations.  The simulation will be
initialized with a 5000 iteration pre-conditioning using the constant
resistivity. A subsequent 1 minute Time Accurate mode will set the
1/16 R_E higher resolution grid, again with constant resistivity of
2.0E9.  All subsequent restarts will restart from this one minute
restart file, where the different reconnection physics parameters will
be turned on from different PARAM files.  The constant resistivity
simulation will serve as our control to compare how the physics and
the magnetosphere changes.

716 - Run of the new simulation initialization conditions with
	constant resistivity.

717 - New initialization with Anomalous Resistivity

718 - New initialization with Hall Effect 1x

719 - New initialization for Hall Effect 2x - COMPLETED

720 - New initialization for Numerical Eta - COMPLETED

721 - New initialization for Constant Eta - COMPLETED

722 - New initialization for Anomalous Eta - COMPLETED

725 - "Normal" magnetospheric run.  #PLASMA command has been turned
	off so that we are using a standard hydrogen plasma.  No
	explicit resistivity is used to calculate the baseline
	numerical resistivity.

726 - Calculated the baseline numerical eta value to be about
	1E11~m2/s (eta / mu_0).  Using a constant explicit resistivity
	value of 2E11 m2/s.

NOTE: This seems a bit high.  It is about four times higher than what
	I was using before and what I used in my PhD research.

727 - Constant explicit resistivity value of 0.8E11 m2/s as used
	before. Current plan is to only run the simulation for 30
	minutes to see how much of a difference this makes and
	compare.

728 - Normal magnetosphere run where the Hall Effect is increased by
	four times. Run for 5 minutes magnetospheric time to see how
	much of a difference it makes.
	
729 - Rerun of run725, only changed SW density to 5/cc to get a
	standard compressed magnetopause inside of 10 Re. Again, no
	explicit resistivity is used to calculate the baseline
	numerical resistivity.

730 - Rerun of run727, only changed SW density to 5/cc to get a
	standard compressed magnetopause inside of 10 Re. 

731 - Rerun of run726, only changed SW density to 5/cc to get a
	standard compressed magnetopause inside of 10 Re.
